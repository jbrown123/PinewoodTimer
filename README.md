# PinewoodTimer
Pinewood derby timer using PC parallel (LPT) port

This is the software for ["The Worlds Least Expensive Pinewood Derby Timer"](http://pinewood.hmpg.net) that I created along with my now departed good friend Dave Owen who was VP of engineering at Novell back in the day.

For many years (decades actually) this software was available via a yahoo group called simply [PinewoodTimer](https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/PinewoodTimer/conversations/messages). Thousands of people from around the world have used this software to time pinewood derbies. Since Yahoo has decided to end it's groups feature I thought it best to make this available elsewhere.

## Software
In addition, for the first time, I'm making the original source code for the timer available. The software itself (the DOS executable) has always been free. Over the years many people have asked for a copy of the source and I've always declined, *until now*.

## Copyright
The copyright in the source code remains in force for the executable.

The source code is copyrighted by me. If you want to use any part of that, please contact me for permission.

## Building
This code was last compiled about 20 years ago using the current Borland C++ compiler at the time. However, with the exception of a few Borland specific preprocessor macros, it should be relatively easily ported to a current C++ compiler.

## Website
I've also included the source files for [the website](http://pinewood.hmpg.net) as well since this information is helpful for understanding how to build the hardware.

## Questions
If you have questions, please feel free to ask. I'll try to answer than in a timely fashion.
