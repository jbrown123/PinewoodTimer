<h1>
Circuit Board</h1>
Here you see a picture of the actual prototype circuit board which I still
use for my track.&nbsp; This was built on a piece of PC prototype card
that I had laying around.
<p>On the top right corner you see two alligator clips that hook to the
start sensor.&nbsp; I use a roll of speaker wire from Radio Shack to run
from the finish line up to the start gate.&nbsp; I was too lazy to cut
the wire and put real connectors on it so I just use a pair of jumpers
to connect the end of the spool to the board.
<p>At the top center you can see the DB25 connector that I use to hook
the board to my parallel port.&nbsp; I just have a custom cable that hooks
only the pins I need (3 lanes, the start sensor and ground).
<p>On the left side (near the card fingers) you can see the red and black
wires that connect to the power supply.&nbsp; I had an old power supply
laying around so I used that for the prototype.&nbsp; The red wire hooks
to the power bus (lower strip) and the black wire hooks to the the ground
bus (the upper strip).&nbsp; Just to the right of the black wire's connection
point you can see the 3 brown wires that run to the ground side of the
phototransistors.
<p>Below the connector you can see the 4 pull-up resisters that drive the
4 signal lines.&nbsp; These resisters are hooked from the power bus across
to where the (white) wires come in from the transistors.&nbsp; The last
resister, on the right, is for the start gate.&nbsp; Above this junction
you can see where the wires hook to the DB25 connector.
<p>The bundle of wires that you see around the outside of the board (under
the DB25 and near the alligator clips) are the sensor wires that run to
the track.&nbsp; I have about 4 feet of wire between the board and each
lane sensor.&nbsp; Each lane sensor actually has three wires hooked to
it.&nbsp; When I originally tested the circuit I thought I might need a
bias resister on the base side so I hooked a wire to all three legs of
the transistor.&nbsp; It turned out that I didn't need the bias so I just
cut the wire part way back on the bundle and taped it down.&nbsp; Thus,
in the bundle there are three wires to each transistor but there are only
two connections on the board.&nbsp; On each lane sensor the white wire
is the pull-up, the brown wire is ground and the third (orange) wire is
not used.&nbsp; I used a bit of heat shrink tubing ever few inches to keep
the bundles for each sensor from separating (you can see a piece of black
heat shrink at the left of the picture).&nbsp; You can see what the other
end looks like in on the <a href="lanes.html#2">lane sensor page</a>.
<p>My board is clearly much larger than you really need.&nbsp; I think
you could actually build all the electronics (pull-up resistors and connectors)
to fit inside a DB25 shell.&nbsp; You could plug it into the printer port
on the back of the PC and have the sensor connections come straight out
of the shell.&nbsp; However, the one I have works for me so I haven't worried
about replacing it with a nicer looking setup.
