Lane Sensors</h1>
Here you can see a couple of pictures of the lane sensors at the end of
the track.
<p>This is the configuration at the end of the track.&nbsp; You can see
the light sensors in small holes in the center of the guide strips for
each lane.

<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="2"></a>Here you can see an individual lane sensor that has
been removed from the track.&nbsp; I remove the sensors before disassembling
the track each time.&nbsp; They are just wedged into the hole in the guide
strip from below.&nbsp; There is a small strip of wood (1"x2") across the
very end of the track, on the bottom, that keeps the sensors from being
crushed between the track and the floor.&nbsp; Another thing you can see
in this picture is that I've labeled each lane sensor so I don't have to
follow wires all over to find the right one for each lane.&nbsp; At the
very top of the picture you can see the sensor for lane 2 installed in
the track.
