<h1>
Finish Line</h1>
Here you can see how the finish line area looks.&nbsp; We use a block of
foam rubber with a pillow on top as our stop area.&nbsp; This seems to
capture the cars without doing too much damage.&nbsp; Though not shown
in the picture, I usually put a chair behind the foam rubber to keep the
cars from pushing it away from the track.
<p>In the foreground, above the track you can see the light fixture that
I use.&nbsp; It is a cheep hardware store clip on light with a 60 watt
bulb.&nbsp; <b>I always carry a spare bulb in my bag, just in case!</b>
<p>I was fortunate enough to have someone build a light stand for me from
a brake rotor and some tailpipe.&nbsp; You can easily use a chair to serve
the same purpose.&nbsp; Just make sure that the light sensors in the track
are flooded with light from the incandescent bulb (see the discussion under
'<a href="index.html#Lamp">The Track</a>' on the main page).
