Start Gate</h1>
Here are a couple of pictures of the start gate arrangement.&nbsp; This
should give you a good idea of how I've arranged my start switch.&nbsp;
Obviously if your start gate is built differently then you need to attach
the switch differently.&nbsp; The critical point is that the switch is
in the open (no contact) position when the gate is open.
<p>The first picture shows the gate in the 'open' position (as though a
race had started).&nbsp; You can see the start switch in the foreground.

<p>In this second picture, you see the gate in the 'ready' position with
the gate up or closed and the switch engaged.

<p>I use the screw, at the bottom left of the switch in the picture, to
tighten up the switch against the side of the track. I only put one screw
in it to allow easy adjustment of the switch against the start gate.
