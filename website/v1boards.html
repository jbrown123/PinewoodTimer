<h1>Information&nbsp;for V1 timer boards</h1>
<p>Here is a picture of the <a href="o_bareboard.jpg" target="picture" title="Picture of just the bare board">bare 
board</a> and a <a href="o_finishedboard.jpg" target="picture" title="Picture of a completed board">completed board</a> for 
reference.</p>
<p>In order to complete the project 
you will need to add the following components:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Right angle, PC board mount DB-25 male connector (unless you buy the 
    kit that includes the connector)</li>
    <li>Five 10K-Ohm resistors (Radio Shack #271-1335, $0.99 for a 5 pack)</li>
    <li>Start switch</li>
    <li>Lane sensors (see parts list above or discussions on the forum for suggestions)</li>
    <li>Hookup wire for start switch and lane sensors</li>
    <li>+5 volt power supply</li>
</ul>
<p>You may not need the resistors OR the 5 volt power supply if your computer 
has built-in pull-up resistors. Unfortunately there is no real way to 
know if your computer has the built-in resistors. Some do, some don't. 
If your computer does not have pull-up resistors your timer may operate 
erratically or it may give sluggish results.</p>
<h2>Assembly Instructions</h2>
<p>Refer to the <a href="o_finishedboard.jpg" target="picture" title="Picture of a completed circuit board">completed 
board photo</a> as necessary:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Make sure you insert all components on the BLANK side of the board. 
    The side with the traces is only used to solder parts in place. There 
    should be no components on the solder side (the side with the traces).</li>
    <li>Insert the pins of the DB-25 connector through the holes and solder 
    the pins in place. It is not necessary to solder every pin. You 
    can simply solder all the pins with traces to them, plus a few on the opposite 
    end of the connector to help hold it in place. &nbsp;In order to keep the 
    board cost low I elected not to put a solder mask on the board. Make sure 
    that you don't accidentally solder bridge between two pins or between a 
    pin and a trace. This is especially easy to do near pin 2, pin 9,&nbsp;and 
    pin 13.</li>
    <li>Next insert the resistors into the holes in the middle of the board. 
    Resistors are not polarized so it doesn't matter which end goes which 
    way. Flip the board over and solder each resistor in place. Again, make 
    sure that you do not solder bridge between a pin and an ajoining trace. 
    &nbsp;Clip off any excess resistor leads that are sticking out of the back of 
    the board.</li>
    <li>Solder wires onto the ends of the phototransistors for each lane. Use 
    one color of wire for the emitter and a different color for the collector 
    on each sensor. This will make the next step MUCH easier and less 
    error prone. Use just enough wire to reach from the back of your PC to the 
    track. I would use no more than 3 to 5 feet of wire on 
    each phototransistor. Each sensor should have the same amount of wire 
    as all the others for proper timing (electricity travels about 9 inches 
    per nanosecond so if one wire is 9 inches shorter than another, the timing 
    will be off by 1 nanosecond between the two sensors). Also solder 
    (or otherwise attach) a wire to each side of the start gate switch. Remember 
    to leave enough wire to stretch all the way to the top of the track.</li>
    <li>Refering to the solder side of the board, note that there are 5 rows 
    of two holes each on the right side of the board. These are the connections 
    for the start gate (at the top, notice the word &quot;start&quot; above 
    the top row of holes) and the lane sensors (rows 2-5 = lanes 1-4 respectively). 
    On the right side of the rows is the word &quot;emitter&quot; which 
    indicates where the emitter from each sensor should be connected (the 
    wire from the collector goes in the other hole in each row). Flip 
    the board back over so you are looking at the component (blank) side and 
    then run the wires through the board and solder them in place making sure 
    to connect the emitter to the correct side on each row. Alternately, 
    you can solder a connector in place (as in the <a href="o_finishedboard.jpg" target="picture" title="Picture of completed board">photo</a>) and then connect 
    the wires to that so that you can attach and remove the sensors easily. 
    While you are at it, solder the wire from the start gate to the top 
    row of holes (polarity does not matter for the start gate, either wire in 
    either hole will work).</li>
    <li>Now hook up a regulated 5 volt power supply to the board. Again 
    refering to the solder side, note the markings for &quot;+5&quot; and &quot;GND&quot; 
    which indicate where the +5 line and the ground line from the power 
    supply should be connected. Note that the power supply is not hooked up 
    in the photo.</li>
    <li>Now, <b>DOUBLE CHECK EVERYTHING!!!</b> I refuse to be held responsible 
    for damage to your computer if you have not connected things correctly and 
    double checked your work. Make sure you have the +5 and ground from 
    the power supply connected correctly. Plug in the power supply and 
    check the voltages with a meter to confirm this. While you are at it, check 
    that the various pins on the DB-25 change state properly when you cover 
    and uncover the phototransistors. You should be able to check this 
    quite easily using a volt meter.</li>
    <li><b>ONLY</b> after you have checked <b>EVERYTHING</b> and then <b>DOUBLE 
    CHECKED</b> everything should you attach the circuit to your PC. Run 
    the pinewood software and use the diagnostics screen to confirm that each 
    of the bits changes state properly when you cover and uncover each phototransistor. 
    Also check that the start gate switch changes states correctly. If 
    not, carefuly review the instructions above to make sure you haven't missed 
    anything. Check closely for phototransistors that are not hooked up correctly 
    (emitter and collector reversed).</li>
</ul>
